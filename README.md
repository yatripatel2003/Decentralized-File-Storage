# Decentralized File Storage System  

This project implements a **Decentralized File Storage System** to securely store and manage images in a transparent and efficient manner. The system features an interactive frontend built using **ReactJS** and a robust backend developed with **Solidity**, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure data integrity.  

## How It Works  
- **Image Upload and Storage**:  
  Users upload images through the ReactJS interface. The images are then stored on the **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**, a decentralized peer-to-peer network.  

- **Hash Generation and Storage**:  
  Each uploaded image generates a unique **hash code**, which is stored on the blockchain using **Solidity**. This hash ensures transparency and traceability.  

- **Retrieval of Images**:  
  The system allows users to access stored images and their associated information anytime, ensuring reliability and decentralization.  

- **Integration with Pinata**:  
  **Pinata** is used to simplify the interaction with IPFS, ensuring seamless image uploads and management.  

## Technologies Used  
1. **ReactJS**: For creating an interactive and user-friendly frontend interface.  
2. **Solidity**: To implement the backend logic on the Ethereum blockchain.  
3. **IPFS**: A decentralized storage solution for efficient file storage and retrieval.  
4. **Ether.js**: To connect the frontend with the Ethereum blockchain and handle smart contract interactions.  
5. **Hardhat**: For testing, deployment, and development of the Solidity smart contracts.  

This project demonstrates the power of decentralization by integrating blockchain and peer-to-peer networks to ensure secure, transparent, and efficient file storage.
